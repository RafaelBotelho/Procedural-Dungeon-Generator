# Procedural-Dungeon-Generator
This is a Produral Dungeon Generator for Unity

The System is based on a grid approach with ScripttablesObjects for the room decorations.
It also includes a A* Pathfinding script that is used to find the paths between rooms, but can be used for other purposes as well.
Feel free to use and modify to your needs.
